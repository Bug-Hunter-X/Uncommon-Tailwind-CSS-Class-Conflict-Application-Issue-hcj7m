  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Uncommon Tailwind Bug</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700">This is some sample text demonstrating a potential bug in Tailwind's class parsing or conflict resolution.  The issue is that sometimes, under specific circumstances such as nested components or complex conditional rendering, Tailwind might fail to apply a class or apply an incorrect class despite seeming correct in the initial code.</p>
